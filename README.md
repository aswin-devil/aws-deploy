A demonstration of how to use AWS CDK Pipelines and Elastic Beanstalk to deploy a web application and speed up the development & deployment process.

In the second part of the guide, I will show you how to deploy the React/Next.Js app as well to s3 and Cloudfront.

In the end, we will build Circleci ci/cd pipelines to deploy our application to staging or production automatically & will set up Papertrail monitory logs for our elastic Beanstalk application.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides a solution for this. It’s a user-friendly service designed for deploying and scaling web applications and services. Supporting various programming languages and server configurations (Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker with servers like Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS), Elastic Beanstalk simplifies deployment by accepting a single ZIP or WAR file. It takes care of tasks like capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring, while still granting us control over the underlying AWS resources.

In this guide, we will learn how to

Deploy your web application by creating an Elastic Beanstalk environment and configuring its settings.
Set up an RDS instance to host your application’s relational database with the desired engine and security settings.
Manage your domain’s DNS records and hosted zones on Route 53 for efficient domain resolution.
Accelerate content delivery and reduce latency by creating a CloudFront distribution, configuring origins, and associating it with your Elastic Beanstalk environment.
Isolate and control your network environment by setting up a Virtual Private Cloud with proper subnets, route tables, and internet gateways.
Define security groups for services like Elastic Beanstalk and RDS to control inbound and outbound traffic securely.
Secure your domain with SSL/TLS certificates from AWS Certificate Manager, associating them with your CloudFront distribution and Elastic Beanstalk environment.
Safely store and manage sensitive information, such as database credentials, using AWS Secrets Manager and integrate it with your Elastic Beanstalk environment.
Create and configure S3 buckets for storing static assets, backups, and other necessary files with proper access controls.
Automate your build and deployment workflows by configuring Circle CI with a .circleci/config.yml file and integrating it with your version control system.
Point your domain to AWS by updating DNS records on Namecheap and associating the domain with your AWS resources.
